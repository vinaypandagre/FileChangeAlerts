#Python Simple file Change alert project
A file change detection program in Python monitors a specified directory for any changes, such as additions, deletions, modifications, or renames of files. The program utilizes hashing functions to track file contents and detect any differences. When a change is detected, the program sends a notification to a specified URL, alerting the user of the update. This ensures that the user is always informed about the latest changes in their files, maintaining data integrity and security.
